# 📖 SpectralReader - Advanced Literary Analysis Engine

[Live Demo 🚀](https://parmindersinghgithub-spectralreader-appmain-4nyq8c.streamlit.app/)

![Demo](demo.gif)

SpectralReader is an AI‑powered literary analysis tool that specializes in character exploration, theme identification, and plot analysis for novels, plays, and short stories. Under the hood, it employs a **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline—combining semantic retrieval of relevant text passages with state‑of‑the‑art generative models—to deliver **accurate**, **transparent**, and **context‑aware** literary insights.

## ✨ Features

- **Character Analysis**: Identify and analyze characters with detailed profiles  
- **Theme Exploration**: Discover underlying themes and motifs  
- **Plot Insights**: Understand narrative structure and key events  
- **Contextual Understanding**: Deep comprehension of literary devices  
- **Transparent Sourcing**: See exactly which passages support each answer  
- **Real‑Time Monitoring**: Processing metrics and resource tracking

## 🧠 Core RAG Architecture

SpectralReader’s RAG pipeline consists of three main phases:

1. **Document Processing**  
   - PDF text extraction & cleaning (via PDFplumber)  
   - Semantic chunking with chapter/scene boundaries  
   - Vector embeddings using MPNet sentence‑transformers  

2. **Dual‑Phase Retrieval**  
   - **Stage 1**: FAISS index for approximate nearest‑neighbour search  
   - **Stage 2**: Cross‑encoder (MiniLM‑L12) reranking for top‑k passage precision  
   - Dynamic context window assembly  

3. **Augmented Generation**  
   - FLAN‑T5 Large conditioned on retrieved & reranked passages  
   - Confidence scores for each response  
   - Prompt templates optimized for literary questions

## 🧪 Usage Guide

1. **Upload** your literary PDF document via the web UI  
2. System performs **semantic chunking** & **embeddings**  
3. **Ask questions** such as:  
   - **Characters**: “Who is the ghost in the story?”  
   - **Themes**: “What are the main themes in Chapter 3?”  
   - **Plot**: “Explain the significance of the climax scene”  
4. Explore the **detailed, sourced insights** generated by the AI
